Because the NLTK library may be too big to install, this file outlines how to install on the required packages of NLTK.

The methods used in the programs from NLTK include:
stopwords
sentence_tokenizer
word_tokenizer

To only install portions of the nltk library, first open a python shell by typing "python"

Then type "import nltk"
and "nltk.download()"

After that you should see options including download and list

You can list the packages to see which ones you need. I believe the only necessary ones are:
stopwords
punkt

stopwords has the stopwords list and punkt can tokenize the words/sentences.

Unfortunately since all of NLTK is already installed on this machine, I can't be certain those are all you need.
