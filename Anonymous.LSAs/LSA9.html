These ancient bacterial cells were engulfed by larger primitive eukaryotic cells lacking the abililites to either respire aerobically or capture energy from sunlight. From this engulfment, a symbiotic relationship formed between the primitive bacterial and primitive eukaryotic cell. The bacterial cell lost its ability to live independently and the eukaryotic cell gained the ability to respire aerobically or capture energy from sunlight.</td>

DNA sequence analysis and phylogenetic estimates suggest that nuclear DNA contains genes that probably came from plastids. These organelles&#039; ribosomes are like those found in bacteria. Much of the internal structure and biochemistry of plastids, for instance the presence of thylakoids and particular chlorophylls, is very similar to that of cyanobacteria. Mitochondria have several enzymes and transport systems similar to those of bacteria. Both mitochondria and plastids have small genomes compared to bacteria. This is consistent with an increased dependence on the eukaryotic host after forming an endosymbiosis. Most genes on the organellar genomes have been lost or moved to the nucleus. Most genes needed for mitochondrial and plastid function are located in the nucleus. Many originate from the bacterial endosymbiont.</td>

Although research is ongoing, treatment options are currently limited; vitamins are frequently prescribed, though the evidence for their effectiveness is limited. Membrane penetrating antioxidants have the most important role in improving mitochondrial dysfunction. Pyruvate has been proposed recently as a treatment option. Spindle transfer, where the nuclear DNA is transferred to another healthy egg cell leaving the defective mitochondrial DNA behind, is a potential treatment procedure that has been successfully carried out on monkeys. Using a similar pronuclear transfer technique, researchers at Newcastle University successfully transplanted healthy DNA in human eggs from women with mitochondrial disease into the eggs of women donors who were unaffected. In June 2013, the United Kingdom government agreed to develop legislation that would legalize the &#039;three-person IVF&#039; procedure as a treatment to fix or eliminate mitochondrial diseases that are passed on from mother to child. The procedure could be offered from 29 October 2015 once regulations had been established.</td>

This transfer can be discussed as a reciprocal translocation between nonhomologous chromosomes or as a non-reciprocal translocation of nonhomologous chromosomes. In a reciprocal translocations, two chromosomes that are not homologous chromosomes to each other both actively switch portions of their individual chromosome, thus, creating a hybrid-like chromosome. In this, both chromosomes act like a receiver and a donor for a piece of that chromosome. However, in a non-reciprocal translocation of nonhomologous chromosomes, only one chromosome acts like the receiver and one acts like the donor. Non-reciprocal translocations consist of the transfer of hereditary material from only one chromosome to be attached to another nonhomologous chromosome. Another way to describe the rearrangement of chromosomes is known as Robertsonian Translocation which is the transfer of a portion of a chromosome amongst these chromosomal numbers only 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. </td>

This theory claims that the mitochondria and the chloroplast were previously prokaryotic organisms, proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, respectively, that coexisted with the now eukaryotic bacteria in a symbiotic relationship. There are numerous evidences that show or support this possible explanation. For instance, both the chloroplast and the mitochondria have their own DNA and have their own replication mechanisms separate from the nucleus. The former prokaryotic organelles have DNA, ribosomes, and transport enzymes like that of bacteria. Furthermore, there are other lines of evidence that suggest this symbiosis between the chloroplast and the mitochondria to the eukaryotic cell and the actual process of the symbioitc event. However, in class I was informed that some facts were overlooked that disagreed with the concept of the endosymbiotic theory due to the fact that individuals wanted every detail to match the idea that was created. </td>

This production of ATP is crucial to allow certain functions to occur within an organism. Furthermore in order to produce this energy, mitochondria must utilize oxygen along with other molecules to initiate the process of aerobic respiration. Therefore, any mutation that results in the reduction of mitochondrias within a cell or inhibits the production of ATP through interference during the exothermic process can result in respiratory diseases. A lower number of mitochondrias directly respond to a lower and limited oxygen absorption or intake and ATP production, thus affecting respiration. </td>

I think it would be really essential if the class were given   information that students should focus on, and those  big ideas should be reflected on what students are being tested on as well. There is a lot of information that can be pulled form these material and big ideas. Giving students main points that are being covered, and actually be tested over those important main ideas is important for various reason.It decreases learning confusion. Sporatic information doesn&#039;t increase long term learning. I think breaking down these information into compartment can really benefit a lot of Genetic students.

I also understand the implications of changes in genetic material, and that in an specific individual with a translocation, they can still be phenotypically normal because they still have all the genetic material they need to function, just in different places now. The biggest effects of translocations is seen in the offspring of individuals with translocation, as relocated genetic material can result in unbalanced segregation of genetic information in gametes, which can result in offspring without the normal amount of genetic material.</td>

Some of the evidence for this theory is that mitochondria have their own, separate DNA that is distinct from the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. Another piece of evidence is the way mitochondria replicate. Mitochondria replicate via the same mechanism as bacteria, that is, they pinch off from the parent through binary fission. Lastly, mitochondria must come from another parent mitochondria, and the cell can’t make itself a new mitochondria if it loses its original one, because it doesn’t have the genetic material or machinery.</td>

The mitochondria is responsible for producing the energy used by the cell, in the from of ATP.

Aerobic cells need to be able to perform the functions related with respiration through the mitochondria in order to get the energy it needs to function properly.I also understand that advantageous mutations that result in even higher or more efficient respiration are what may have led to the incorporation of the ancient prokaryotic bacteria into the cell as the mitochondria.</td>

                    <td>I understand that similar to translocations, inversions in individuals have a variety of outcomes, one of which being that an individual is still phenotypically normal despite the inversion. Inversions occur when segments of chromosomal DNA break, then reform connect to the rest of the chromosome in a backwards manner—that is, they are inverted. Inversion do not result in a lost of genetic material in an individual, but because of how genes are regulated via mechanism such as promoter sequences, inversions also have the ability to shut off genes or prevent genes from being turned on in the normal way. In these cases, inversions lead to a loss or lessening of gene products, but the individual still has the non-inverted homolog that may be sufficient in producing the needed gene products. When an individual with an inversion passes its inverted copy of the chromosome to progeny, the offspring will still inherit the proper amount of genetic material, but again, depending on gene regulation specific to the genes in question, there are a variety of phenotypic results.

Obviously, advantageous mutations that occurred in the ancient prokaryotic cell that was incorporated into the cytoplasm of the host cell resulted in the existence of present day cells. However, the specific implications of present day mutations in individuals seem unclear. I understand that since most mutations are deleterious, most of these present day mutations should negatively impact the ability of the mitochondria to perform its role in respiration, but I am a little unclear about whether or not mutations could also lead to even more efficient or better respiration (like they did throughout evolution). </td>
