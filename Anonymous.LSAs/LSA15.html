The TATA box is the core promoter while there are also proximal promoter elements. The CAAT box and the GC sequence are example of proximal promoter elements.

DNA sequencing has allowed for both genomic and complementary libraries, which are pivotal tools in genetics research. A genomic library has one copy of all the sequences of the genome that the researcher is investigating.

These enzymes do more than just cut the DNA at random, rather, they bind and cut the DNA at a specific place in the sequence, giving various fragments of the DNA strand. When this technique is used on a specific sample of DNA, that DNA sample is said to be digested. By using restriction enzymes in research, the fragments that result from the digest by restriction enzymes can be analyzed for their size. Using known restriction enzymes (over 3000 options), geneticists can determine whether or not an individual has a mutation at a specific restriction site because of the presence or absence of a fragment in the gel (that they use to tell how big the fragments are).</td>

Transcription factors are trans-acting because they are recruited to numerous promoter regions in eukaryotic gene transcription to begin the process. These transcription factors must be trans-acting so they can be recruited from anywhere near by in the nucleolus. Trans-factors allow a more efficient process of transcription initiation, since they can act on more than just the gene they are right next to. However, these transcription factors are regulated because it would be very bad if they could float to any gene at any time and turn it on. The way that transcription factors are regulated is by their recognition of specific DNA binding motifs. These motifs signal to the transcription factors that this is where they need to bind in the genome. </td>

                    <td>Transcription factors are proteins involved in the process of converting, or transcribing, DNA into RNA. Transcription factors include a wide number of proteins, excluding RNA polymerase, that initiate and regulate the transcription of genes. One distinct feature of transcription factors is that they have DNA-binding domains that give them the ability to bind to specific sequences of DNA called enhancer or promoter sequences. Some transcription factors bind to a DNA promoter sequence near the transcription start site and help form the transcription initiation complex. Other transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences, such as enhancer sequences, and can either stimulate or repress transcription of the related gene. These regulatory sequences can be thousands of base pairs upstream or downstream from the gene being transcribed. Regulation of transcription is the most common form of gene control. The action of transcription factors allows for unique expression of each gene in different cell types and during development.</td>

The new technologies do, however, also provide a bridge between genotype and phenotype, both in man and model (as well as all other) organisms, revolutionize the identification of elements involved in a multitude of human diseases or other phenotypes, and generate a wealth of medically relevant information on every single person, as the basis of a truly personalized medicine of the future.</td>

Unlike mutation, this change was reversible, and one cycle of growth in the previous host returned the virus to its original form. These simple observations heralded the discovery of the endonuclease and methyltransferase activities of what are now termed Type I, II, III and IV DNA restriction-modification systems. The Type II restriction enzymes (e.g. EcoRI) gave rise to recombinant DNA technology that has transformed molecular biology and medicine. This review traces the discovery of restriction enzymes and their continuing impact on molecular biology and medicine.</td>

For numerous reasons, including organizational maintenance, energy conservation, and generating phenotypic variance, it is important that genes are only expressed when they are needed. The most efficient way for an organism to regulate genetic expression is at the transcriptional level. Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) function to control transcription by acting nearby or within a gene. The most well characterized types of CREs are enhancers and promoters. Both of these sequence elements are structural regions of DNA that serve as transcriptional regulators.</td>

This regulatory region includes the site where transcription is initiated and the region approximately 35 bp upstream or downstream from the initiation site. Promoters usually have the following four components: the TATA box, a TFIIB recognition site, an initiator, and the downstream core promoter element. Interestingly, it has been found that a single gene can contain multiple promoter sites. In order to initiate transcription of the downstream gene, a host of DNA-binding proteins called transcription factors (TFs) must bind sequentially to this region. Only once this region has been bound with the appropriate set of TFs, and in the proper order, can RNA polymerase bind and begin transcribing the gene. Contrastingly, enhancers influence transcription of genes on the same molecule of DNA and can be found upstream, downstream, within the introns, or even relatively far away from the gene they regulate. Multiple enhancers can act in a coordinated fashion to regulate transcription of one gene.</td>

Once TRIID is bound to the TATA box, other transcription factors can be recruited, eventually forming a platform for RNA Polymerase II, which does the actual action of transcription.

We studied two different methods to retrieve this data. The first is the Sanger Protocol which uses ddNTP to halt the addition of more structures to the 3&#039; position of the sugar because it lacks the normal -OH group. This sequence is then labeled and analyzed with different colors. The other method is pyrosequencing which entails the use of ssDNA and DNA polymerase.

We have not discussed trans-acting factors yet. What are some of the properties of different trans-acting factors:
subunits of RNA polymerase
bind to RNA Polymerase to stabilize the initiation complex
bind to all promoters at specific sequences but not to RNA Polymerase (TFIID factor which binds to the TATA box)
bind to a few promoters and are required for transcription initiation; these are positive regulators of gene expression
Those factors which bind to consensus module sequences can bind to any promoter that contains the sequence. The binding of multiple factors, for example, multiple trans-acting factors each with one of the four properties mentioned above, may be essential for transcription initiation.</td>
