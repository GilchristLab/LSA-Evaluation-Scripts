I understand the implications that frequencies that do not match Hardy Weinberg predictions represent populations that are evolving in ways that break the Hardy Weinberg assumptions. </td>

                    <td>I understand that males and females have different sex chromosomes, and therefore calculating the frequency of alleles of sex linked genes is different than autosomal genes. When calculating the frequency in female humans, you use the standard p2+2pq+q2=1 formula. This is because females have two X-chromosomes. However, in males, who have only one X chromosome, the formula is simplified to p+q=1. Therefore, it is crucial to consider which half of the population you are measuring. </td>

I understand that this extra viral DNA is then repackaged into new viruses and expelled from the cell, with the intent of moving onto a new cell and beginning the process all over again. However, sometimes during this repackaging phase of viral infection, the new viruses pick up bacterial DNA. They can then carry this bacterial DNA from one bacterial cell to another, where it can be integrated into a new bacteria&#039;s DNA. As long as the virus does not lyse the second bacterium, then it will go on to reproduce through asexual reproduction and further proliferate the hybrid DNA. </td>

By interrupting the conjugation at various time intervals and then applying an antibiotic to kill the donor HFR cells, geneticists can observe the phenotypes of the remaining cells and create a time map of the genes that transferred from the HFR bacterium to the F- bacterium. This gives solid evidence of the order in which the genes are positioned on the plasmid. I find this to be a very logical process, although it appears extremely difficult at first. </td>

We know that color blindness is an x linked recessive trait.  Since women have two x linked genes, the likelihood of her being homozygous for this recessive gene is significantly low.  Men, only having one x chromosome, have a much higher risk of being colorblind.  We can also apply binomial theorem to sex linked traits.  p^2 + 2pq +q^2 = 1; this equation represents the ratio of individuals in a population and the variables are their genes, e.g., p is allele A, and q is allele a.  Since men have only one x chromosome, we can use the square root of this equation, and the q frequency will actually represent their frequency of either the dominant or recessive x chromosome. </td>

A small percentage of that host cell&#039;s bacterial DNA are also packaged into capsules. This packaged bacterial DNA becomes the transducing phage. When a phage injects this DNA into a new host cell, part the DNA may be integrated into the bacterial chromosome via recombination.

Therefore, Chi square test- a statistical method for calculating the goodness of fit between observed value and expected value. The chi square test can be used to calculate data, is the variation in data due to chance or is it due to one of the variables that we are testing.

For example, color blindness is female is 1/1250 =0.0008. q2=0.0008 and q= 1/34. It means 1/34 women have colorblindness.

The prevalence of certain alleles can be calculated for specific populations, according to the Hardy Weinberg principle. A practical use of the Hardy Weinberg principle is that it allows us to make predictions about allele frequencies in populations. The chi square test allows us to compare predicted allele frequencies with observed allele frequencies in a population.

If an allele is X-linked, then a female will have twice the number of alleles or copies of the gene than males in the population since males only have one copy of the X-chromosome. By doubling the allele frequency for females, we can account for this discrepancy. As far as genotype frequencies, males are hemizygous since they only have one copy of the X chromosome with no corresponding homolog. While females in the population will still be homozygous or heterozygous, the hemizygous males will have only one allele (no combination) of the X-linked gene. </td>

Generalized transduction refers to situations where the bacterial genetic material is floating in the cytoplasm, and all the genes have the same random  probability that they will be incorporated into the phage head.  The chance that certain bacterial DNA will be recombined through transduction via the virus is random. Specialized transduction refers to situations where only strain specific genes are transduced via the virus to the bacterium, meaning this type of transduction of DNA is not random.</td>

While cystic fibrosis is not a sex-linked gene, we have seen the implications and usefulness of determining the frequency of alleles and genotypes. Especially in situations where the allele in question is a mutated allele that results in disease or loss of function in the body, being able to determine frequencies in given populations is helpful in both making predictions and determining possible reasons behind the relative increase or decrease in allele frequency in a population. While this is important with cystic fibrosis, it would be even more important for sex-linked genes such as X-linked genes because males are hemizygous for the X chromosome and express even recessive X-linked disease with just one copy. </td>

As with all the results of empirical research, there must be an operationalized, working definition of what constitutes “significant” or when data can be considered influential when compared to controls or baselines.

To start of with, HFR bacteria are always donors, they are a special class of F+ cells, and they result from the spontaneous integration of the F factor (fertility factor) plasmid into their chromosome. HFR stands for high frequency of recombination, and by using a technique called the interrupted matings technique, specific genes can be identified based on the time it takes them to undergo recombination. Experiments that utilized the interrupted mating technique led to the discovery that the E. coli linkage map is circular. This is a crucial piece of information that can tell us a lot about the nature of bacterial DNA and chromosomes. Maps are constructed using time, as well as the fact that depending on the location that the fertility factor is integrated in the HFR chromosome, the temporal order of genes that recombine changes, but the actual order or relative position along the circular chromosome is always the same. Using different HFR strains in mapping experiments allows for many “timelines” to be observed and then reconstructed relative to each other, ultimately forming the circular bacterial gene map. </td>

The chi square value is used as a warning that the population is not in equilibrium and that one or more of the 5 qualifications are not being met. We can use the chi square value and it&#039;s location on the chart to either reject of accept our null hypothesis that leads us to either see if the inconsistencies are due to chance or if they are there for a reason. Just because we don&#039;t think the population in study is under Hardy Weinberg does not mean that one mutation is due to chance until we calculate chi square and analyze. </td>

                    <td>The Chi Square Analysis is a method used by various scientists to determine if a hypothesis and its results are statistically significant. The Chi Square Value is denoted by the letter &#039;X&#039; and is equivalent to the square root of observed minus expected squared over the expected. This value and the degrees of freedom, which is normally the number of variables minus one, but in this case there is only one degree of freedom since only one value is unknown and that one value, if known, can be used to calculate the rest of the variables, are used together to determine if the value is below or above 0.05. If the values are above 0.05 then the experiment’s hypothesis is generally refuted due to the fact that the value is not statistically significant; However, it is highly likely to get a value above the 0.05 mark when discussing allele frequencies within a population so that variation can be used to determine which condition is being broken in order to “ensure the effects” of the Hardy- Weinberg Law. Thus, the Chi Square Test can be used to portray discrepancies within the Hardy- Weinberg Law and allows one to determine the cause of the said discrepancy.</td>

The first equation is used to determine the frequency of either the dominant (p) or the recessive allele (q), whereas, the second equation is used to determine the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals, heterozygotes, and homozygous recessive individuals, respectively. However in the case of sex linked genes, the first equation is used specifically for males in the sense that in sex linked genes, males can either have the disorder or not have it due to the fact that males have only one X chromosome. Females on the other hand have two X chromosomes, so the second equation corresponds to the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals, carriers, and homozygous recessive individuals. This application of the Hardy Weinberg formulas right fully depicts the fact that males are more susceptible to sex-linked disorders than females. </td>

This insertion of the viral DNA becomes incorporated into the bacteria’s genome and sometimes a piece of the bacterial chromosome is detached along with the viral DNA before the lysis of the bacterial cell to allow the manufacturing of the viral parts. Once that infected cell lyses, the new viral cells carry their DNA and the bacterial DNA to infect other bacterium. Through this process, viruses, in a way, allow the transfer of bacterial genes to the other bacteria. In specialized transduction, only certain specified genes of the bacterial DNA are transduced; whereas, generalized transduction deals with the random bacterial genes that are transduced by the assistance of viruses. </td>

This application is intriguing since the same two equations are used, but with different methods. The first equation directly correlates to the case in sex linked genes in the male population since males only have one X chromosome which determines if the individual will have the said disorder; whereas, since females have two X chromosomes, which are helpful in the situation of a recessive disease, they can be carriers of the disease thus the second equation is more befitting. I find it fascinating that such a link between sex linked genes and the Hardy Weinberg Equation is even possible. This connection was confusing initially, but after I understood how this could be applied, I understood the importance of such a tool. </td>

                    <td>The chi square analysis is a scientific, mathematical tool that is used to determine the significance of the results observed in relation to the hypothesis tested. This chart shows that any value below the 0.05 mark is statistically significant and the hypothesis is supported by the results. In this case, it is expected for the results to be above the value of 0.05 if it is conducted in the real world rather than a lab simulation. This expectation can enable researchers to determine the cause of this high value in relation to the stipulations or conditions created by the Hardy Weinberg Law. For instance in a large population where there is a high immigration rate, scientists can use that Chi Square Test to determine if the high immigration rate is the cause that allele frequencies do not remain constant from generation to generation. A value greater than 0.05 does not necessarily correlate to the fact that the high immigration rate is the cause of allele frequency fluctuations amongst generations of that population, it is just an indication that one of the conditions required in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium is being broken. (It is up to the researcher to determine the cause of this high value.) I find it interesting how this mathematical model can be applied to general populations and the allele frequencies within that population. </td>

All of these situations are highly likely within a real population thus implying that the majority of the time the results reviewed are not statistically significant  since the conditions required for  Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium are simply ideal and not realistic.

I know that transduction is a method in which variation amongst bacterial cells increases due to the exchange of genetic material. In this process, a virus injects its DNA into its host cell (the bacterial cell) and that DNA incorporates into the bacterial DNA and can activate the production of viral parts to create more viruses. At times, a portion of the bacterial DNA is connected to the viral DNA and can break off from the rest of the bacterial DNA, thus that bacterial DNA becomes placed within the viral parts (protein head and legs). Once that bacterial cell lyses, it allows the viral offspring and the &quot;defected&quot; virus which encodes bacterial cell DNA to inject itself to another bacterium and incorporate into that bacterial cell&#039;s DNA. I understand that the difference between specialized and generalized transduction is the type of genes that are transfixed via viruses. Specialized transduction is related to only specific bacterial sequences whereas generalized transduction corresponds to random bacterial DNA being transduced. The only question I have in this concept is if the &quot;defected&quot; viral cell can cause the third bacterial cell to produce viral parts and eventually lyse. </td>

I do know that HFR and F&#039; are special cases of F+ bacteria, but I still get confused between the two classifications. In contrast, I do understand the difference between an F+ and a F- bacterium ( the presence and absence of a plasmid called the fertility factor). I do understand that when a F+ and a F- bacterium mate through the formation of a sex pili, the F- bacterium transforms into a F+ since the fertility factor is transferred. Furthermore, I understand that when a HFR bacteria mates with a F- bacterial cell, the F- remains F- since the F factor is transferred last and usually the sex pili breaks before the F factor can be transferred. </td>

F- bacteria do not contain the fertility plasmid. Unlike when crossing a F+ and F- cell, when a Hfr and a F- cells are crossed the F- cell will remain that way. Scientists also noticed that crossing HfrxF- showed recombination of certain genes more than others. That is because through an experiment called interrupted mating technique, it was shown that depending on the Hfr strain, certain genes are transferred and recombined sooner than others which lead to the knowledge that the chromosome of the Hfr was transferred linearly. The conjugation tube could break at random times showing which genes were transferred earliest and this was used to determine the order of genes on the bacterial chromosome. Bacterial chromosomes were shown to be circular by using this process.</td>

Specialized transduction results in the movement of only specific genes. the viruses that carry out specialized transduction are called lysosgenic virus. they have a mechanism for replication that is different from that of generalized transduction, for they integrate their DNA directly into the chromosome of its host&#039;s genome. each tome the host chromosome is duplicated, so is the integrated viral DNA</td>
