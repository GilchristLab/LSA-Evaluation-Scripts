I think it&#039;s because humans are more complex, and each chromosome is critical in development even more so than in crop plants. I understand that aneuploidy causes crop plants to be infertile, but I am still unsure if there are any benefits to this except this causes them to be seedless. Are there any other benefits? </td>

I have a few questions about discussion this week, so I am going to text the people in my discussion group about it. I will then ask my TA if I still have questions. I also think I will do the Mastering Genetics in preparation for the test next week!</td>

Turner&#039;s syndrome, for example, results in monosomy of the X chromosome. Since one X chromosome is usually converted into a Barr body the individual will most likely live, but still phenotypically different. They will be  female, but with external genitalia and internal ducts, rudimentary ovaries, underdeveloped breasts, cognitive impairment, and short stature is a far cry from &quot;little effect&quot; on phenotype. 
  Another example: Kleinfelter&#039;s syndrome results in males with one Barr body (XXY). They also are far from being phenotypically normal. Tall stature, poor beard and chest hair growth, female pattern pubic hair, testicular atrophy, osteoprorosis, impaired cognition, and most importantly breast development. 
  It should be noted that the time at which the Barr bodies are formed is crucial to phenotypic development. Individuals that are polysomic for the X chromosome can very well be phenotypically normal, or completely different. It all depends on when the extra X chromosome(s) is/are packaged up and not expressed. It is obvious that some alterations in phenotype are possible early in embryonic  development due to the prevalence of the dramatic effect increases or decreases in X chromosome number has on human phenotype.</td>

Aneuploidy can be tolerated by many plants, but in mammals and humans, monosomy in particular poses a high risk for death because having only one copy of each gene unmasks any recessive lethal genes that would have gone unnoticed. With only one copy of each gene, it only takes one lethal allele for the individual to die. Autosomal monosomies are very rarely found, implying that the gametes that lack a single chromosome are functionally impaired in a way that prevents them from reaching term. In terms of specific scenarios in which anueploidy in humans occurs, trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, is a relatively common aneuploidy condition in humans. Other than Down syndrome, two other human Trisomies can survive to term. These two trisomies are Patau syndrome and Edwards syndrome. </td>

One of the common phenotypic effects of increased chromosomal material is the production of unviable offspring. This may at first seem counter-intuitive that we would use these plants in crop plants today, but producing sterile offspring also means producing seedless offspring, which is desirable for many consumers.

Barr bodies ensure that regardless of how many extra copies of the X chromosome there are, deactivation of extra copies leads to similar gene expression as an individual with the correct number of copies of the X chromosome. Additional support for this theory comes from evaluation of individuals with Turner syndrome, 45X females with only one copy of the X chromosome.

                    <td>I understand that an increase or decrease in the X chromosome has little effect on a human phenotype because of the phenomenon of Barr bodies. I understand that in each cell only one X chromosome may be expressed. I understand that each cell randomly selects one of the two X chromosomes present to have expressed. The other X is coated in RNA and becomes a &quot;Barr Body.&quot; I understand that this is the case in all diploid cells, but also that in cells with extra X chromosomes present there will simply be more Barr bodies. Thus, the number of Barr bodies present is found by subtracting one from the number of X chromosomes present in the cell. Since this formula yields 0 Barr bodies in a cell with only one X, it is clear that a cell with only one X can still survive since only one X is expressed anyways.</td>

Many of our crops are autopolyploids (multiple sets of chromosomes that are identical to the parent species) and are larger than the “normal” diploid crops. This is not due to more cells, but larger cells since each individual cell in an autopolyploid has to contain multiple sets of chromosomes.

This mutation is where a person has 3 21 chromosomes rather than 2. 75% of these errors leading to Down syndrome are caused by nondisjunction during meiosis I.  There are other syndromes similar to trisomy 21.  These are interesting because they are seen in the human population and are not lethal.  Some of these disorders can be hereditary also. The chance of down syndrome occurring increased with maternal age because nondisjunction is more likely to occur. </td>

                    <td>Increases or decreases in the number X chromosomes such as in Klinefelter’s and Turner’s  are known to create an effect on the individual afflicted, but that effect itself is on a smaller scale. For instance, an individual with Klinefelter’s Syndrome usually has a genotype of XXY (47 chromosomes) thus having at least two X chromosomes; whereas, an individual with Turner’s Syndrome simply is presented as XO (45 chromosomes) in which the O represents the lack of a sex chromosome. The reason why the majority of these individuals are relatively normal, physically and mentally, even though there is an abnormal chromosomal number is due to the fact that only one X chromosome remains active and the other X chromosome is generally condensed and packaged away to the side of the nucleus (known as Barr Bodies). Therefore, the lack of one X chromosome is synonymous to males in the sense that there are no Barr Bodies. The amount of Barr Bodies is one less than the actual number of X chromosomes present. A possible hypothesis for the presence of some abnormalities within the individuals afflicted with similar conditions is that the possible expression of the genes on the extra chromosome before the processing and packaging of that chromosome to the side of the nucleus. </td>

However, in humans certain scenarios are known to defy the statement above since the individual can tolerate the excess or the lack of an autosomal or a sex chromosome(s). For instance, trisomy 21 which is also known as Down Syndrome in humans serves as an example in which three chromosome 21 can exist and that individual can function normally although there is some slow mental development. Two other trisomies are all tolerated as well within the human species and that is trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome) and 18 ( Edwards&#039; Syndrome). The two disorders described above along with a disorder that results in XYY or even XXX and so on is also tolerated within the human population. </td>

For instance, a regular watermelon with the proper number of chromosomes is known to produce seeds within that watermelon; however, increasing the set of chromosomes from two to three produces seedless watermelons. Therefore, such manipulation within the fruit is normal to enable populations to eat the food without the seeds. Also, some fruits such as strawberries and grapes become in icreasingly larger in size with variation in chromosome number those allows for preferred consummation by the human population.  </td>

It is fascinating that this concept can be used to explain specific genetic diseases that vary from the norm on the basis of the  number of a chromosomes. Since the X chromosome encodes for the same material but the genes upon that X chromosome may vary, there may be some &quot;leakage&quot; from the X chromosome that becomes the Barr Body within that cell. I am also interested in how Barr Bodies are formed and the process it goes thru to be packaged to the side of the nucleus of that specific cell such as one&#039;s cheek cell also known as the squamous cell. Therefore, the packaging of any extra X chromosome inhibits any excess effect of having multiples of the X chromosome upon the individual, but some effects are noticed. </td>

For example, since a genotypic normal male has one X chromosome and a normal female has two XX chromosomes, the male and female will only get the same expression if one of the females X chromosomes did not count. Otherwise, hers would be expressed twice as much as the male&#039;s. Barr bodies help this situation. Barr bodies are when one of the X chromosomes is inactivated. The equation for this is &quot;n-1&quot; so the male fully expresses his X chromosome, while one of the female&#039;s is inactivated (2-1=1). It is like they both only have 1 X chromosome.</td>
