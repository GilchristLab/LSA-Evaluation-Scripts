I also understand that after the primer is removed, the gaps in the middle of the DNA strands are filled; however, the gaps at the 5’ end of the DNA strand remain unfilled. This is where the enzyme telomerase steps in. Telomerase has an RNA component that aligns with the over-hanging telomere of the 3’ strand of DNA. Through reverse transcription, the RNA then attracts base pairs and synthesizes more DNA on the telomere, moving further away from the double helix as it does so. Telomerase then releases from the DNA, allowing primase and DNA polymerase to fill the gap. After the gap is filled, the primer is removed and DNA ligase seals the gap. </td>

I understand that this view is strengthened by the appearance of “puffs”, or small bulges, that occur when the gene is being transcribed into RNA.

This means that there is only one origin of replication in prokaryotes, because the DNA polymerases can simply go all the way around the circle. In eukaryotes, however, there are many origins of replication because the DNA strands are so much larger—it would simply take too long to copy the DNA from one spot. The Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand are also smaller in eukaryotes because the nucleosomes must be moved. I understand that eukaryotes have telomeres at the end of the linear DNA strand which allow the gap left by the RNA primer to be filled. </td>

Therefore, the length of the Chromosomes gets shorter. This results in various biological consequences. For instance. based on numerous studies the length of the DNA has been linked to many aspects that affects an organism life. In fact, the length of DNA is linked to aging and death of the person which has been shown in mice already. Therefore, if researchers get the telomerase enzyme to function in the adult somatic cell then the average life expectancy can be increased. </td>

Hence the amount of the chromosomes inside a cell become congregated and due to this they become over sized.

According to a study in various organism, they have found that in organism such as Drosophila these bands and interbands reveals differential gene activity. They found correlation between pattern of band formation and gene activation which is observed under development.

Heterochromatin is not active in gene transcription. It is late replicative unlike euchromatin which is early replicative. In short, heterochromatin is the condensed form of DNA, found when it is arranged in chromosomes etc, for cell division and the like. however heterochromatin is not able to be transcribed for protein production, as it is still tightly packed. on the other hand, euchromatin is loosely packed, which allows mRNA molecules to transcribe the amino acid sequence coded for by that particular portion of DNA, and thus allows protein synthesis to occur.</td>

It has been suggested that the erosion of telomeres are related to cell aging. While human somatic cells do not have telomeres, this is a huge opportunity that could potentially open many doors in humanity&#039;s near future. While immortal cells would certainly increase the risk of mutations and therefor cancer, it is an important topic in today&#039;s research.</td>

                    <td>In DNA replication, DNA polymerase has to have something to “hold on” to. This need is resolved with the use of RNA primers that will go a few base pairs away from the area of DNA that will be synthesized, allowing DNA polymerase to hook itself onto the DNA strand and perform replication. This process works well in organisms that have circular chromosomes, such as in prokaryotes, and in non chromosomal genetic information, like mitochondrial DNA. However, unlike these examples, eukaryotic organisms have a linear DNA strand. This creates a problem because the end of the strand, the space occupied by the primer (which is necessary to synthesize the new strand) is left not replicated. This results in successive loss and shortening at the end of the nascent DNA strand, which is lethal because cells with incorrect genomes are ultimately degraded. To solve this issue of “chewing up” the end of the chromatin, eukaryotic cells have long tandem repeated sequences at the end of the linear strands. This region of repeated sequences is called the telomere, and it is crucial, because replication will “eat away” at the ends of the strand. The excess of repeated sequences ensures that no genes are consumed at the end of the strand as the strand shortens. An additional enzyme, telomerase, lengthens the ends of the chromatin, maintaining the repeated sequences that comprise the telomere. Usually, cells are eventually marked for apoptosis, and the telomerase will no longer function in maintaining the repetitive sequences at the ends of the chromosome, and the “chewed up” DNA  ultimately be degraded at the appropriate time.</td>

Polytene chromosomes are one specialized form of genetic information in eukaryotic organisms that have allowed researchers to identify gene locations. Polytene chromosomes are found in various cells in various organisms, but are not the normal form of genetic information. Polytene chromosomes are huge chromosomes that exist as paired homologs present in somatic cells. These chromosomes are the result of extensive DNA replication. Because they contain so many copies of identical genetic information, these excessive duplications appear as bands on the chromosomes. Each distinct band represents more than just one functional gene, and as such, it is still uncertain just how many genes are contained in each particular band. However, polytene chromosomes were nonetheless instrumental in the identification of many gene locations along the chromosome.</td>

                    <td>Unlike prokaryotic organisms that have simple circular chromosomes that are made entirely of essential genes, eukaryotic chromosomes have an extra layer of gene regulation accomplished by structural modifications to the linear DNA strands. Heterochromatic regions of the chromosome are areas in which structural modifications have effectively silenced, or disabled, the genetic information in this region from being accessible for transcription. These heterochromatic regions are dense, packed structures that consist of nucleosomes. The reason these regions stain dark is because they represent densely packed regions of genetic information, and they collectively absorb more stain. Nucleosomes are structures that arise along the strand of DNA that are comprised of eight histone proteins, each of which are wrapped 1.7 times with the strand of DNA. By wrapping DNA strands around these histone proteins, and then clumping theses wrapped bunches into even higher level structures of condensation, eukaryotic organisms can fit their massive linear DNA strand in the nucleus of every cell. However, there is a trade off in the condensed packing because the genes contained in the packed regions of the strand are silenced when they are in this form. On the other hand, euchromatic regions of the strand are the regions where the genes are accessible and therefore are active. These portions are linear, with plenty of space for the necessary enzymes and proteins involved in transcription to access the DNA sequence. These regions stain lighter because they much less dense regions of DNA, and the stain is less absorbed. </td>

While these structural changes may not be via the same mechanism as what we traditionally associate with heterochromatic regions (nucleosome structures with eight histone proteins wrapped with DNA), the effects seen by both these OFF/ON mechanisms are similar in that they both represent the gene regulation that results from differential gene expression in various cells. </td>

In addition to uncontrolled replication, more and more mutations accumulate in the DNA of these cancer cells (since they’re alive way longer than they should be).

The only aspect of this topic I don’t feel totally comfortable with is how the epigenetic mechanisms of chemical modifications and structural changes interacts with this mechanism of gene regulation. </td>

                    <td>I understand that the process of DNA replication in eukaryotes and prokaryotes may appear similar at first glance, but in actually, the process is much different in pivotal ways. First, prokaryotic DNA replication involves the replication of a circular chromosome, while eukaryotic DNA replication involves the replication of a linear chromosome. As mentioned earlier, if DNA replication of the linear chromosome occurred in the same fashion as it does in circular DNA, the genetic material of eukaryotic organisms would be successively shorten with each round of replication (which would lead to unviable daughter cells). A second difference is that eukaryotic organisms use two different polymerases to copy the leading and lagging strand. A third difference is that DNA replication of the eukaryotic chromosome is much slower than in prokaryotic cells (25 times slower). The slow nature of DNA replication is made up for in eukaryotes by their fourth distinction, that is, having multiple origins of replication, versus prokaryotes that only have one origin of replication. The last main difference between DNA replication in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is the initiation of replication. In eukaryotes, primer RNA is replaced with DNA, and the origin of replication C protein (ORC) recognizes A-T rich regions and binds to the adjacent site.</td>

I found that the most comprehensive way for me to retain the information presented in this course is to take notes in lecture, and then take separate notes from the book. I have implemented these outside resources such as various online video resources and PDF files of concept explanations and practice problems/activities posted via other universities. The hardest part for me is understanding how these specialized chromosomes came about and how they are not degraded in the cell, since organisms contain so many mechanisms to degrade unusual or unexpected genetic information. I plan to meet with my classmates in a study group and hopefully they can help me understand more fully this concept.</td>

This works fine for the 3&#039; to 5&#039; strand of the chromosome because the DNA polymerase can move uninterruptedly from the origin of replication until it meets another point of replication or the end of the chromosome. However this is only the case for 3&#039; to 5&#039;. Synthesis involving the 5&#039; to 3&#039; strand is discontinuous. Discontinuous replication produces a series of short DNA fragments called Okazaki fragments that are complementary to the template strand.

In such cases, the double-stranded loose ends can fuse to other such ends; if they don&#039;t fuse, they are vulnerable to degradation. The newly created gap in lagging strand is filled in with addition of nucleotide to the adjacent 3&#039;-OH group, so there is no Okazaki fragments.

In such cases, the double-stranded loose ends can fuse to other such ends; if they don&#039;t fuse, they are vulnerable to degradation. The newly created gap in lagging strand is filled in with addition of nucleotide to the adjacent 3&#039;-OH group, so there are no Okazaki fragments. The gap remains in the lagging trans resulting in shortening the double-stranded with the length of RNA primer. As more replication occurs the length shortens, deleting the potential gene-coding regions. I don&#039;t understand why the leading strand is not a problem in the telomeres replication problem.

They create inert chromosome ends that protect the chromosomes from improper fusion or degradation. When eukaryotic cells undergo DNA replication, RNA primers provide the 3&#039;-OH necessary to initiate synthesis. However, at the 5&#039; ends of newly synthesized DNA, there are gaps that cannot be filled by DNA polymerase because there are no free 3&#039;-OH groups for the initiation of synthesis. Thus, the replicated strands are shorter than the template strands since there are gaps at the end. Over time. this could be a problem as strands become shorter and shorter after each replication. However, telomerase serves to fix this problem by pairing part of an RNA strand with the end of the sequence of the single-stranded overhanging DNA while the rest extends beyond this overhang. Then reverse transcription produces an extension of the DNA strand. Then, once the telomere has been lengthened by this activity,conventional DNA synthesis ensues.</td>

                    <td>I understand that without a primer, no DNA replication in eukaryotes can occur and that this primer uses both RNA and DNA. Meanwhile, I understand that in prokaryotes the primer is made of RNA.  In eukaryotes, there can be many different origins of replication and thus replication bubbles while in prokaryotes there is only one single origin of replication. I understand that the length of Okazaki fragments differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as prokaryotes can have longer Okazaki fragments. I also understand that eukaryotic replication is much slower than prokaryotic replication but that eukaryotes carry many more genes than prokaryotes. Also, because eukaryotic chromosomes are linear they have a problem caused by telomere shortening while prokaryotic chromosomes that are circular are not subject to this problem.</td>

Polytene chromosomes are paired homologs which is highly unusual. They have extensive banding and form “puffs” which represent areas of gene activity. 
Lampbrush chromosomes are very large with extensive DNA looping and are easily isolated during prophase I of meiosis. The loops in lampbrush chromosomes are similar to polytene chromosomes puffs as they represent sites of gene activity

Furthermore, shortened telomeres have been noticed and associated with cancer cells but longer telomere sequences have been associated with aging, thus making it a prime candidate for research especially during DNA replication. Telomeres are tandem repeats found at the end of chromosomes that are produced by the enzyme called telomerase so the actual genes on a chromosome do not get affected by cell replication and cell division during mitosis in somatic cells. The enzyme telomerase controls the amount of sequenced telomeres are placed and paired since DNA polymerase cannot add bases to the ends of linear chromosomes due to a problem from RNA primers. I unfortunately do not know the problem that was caused, but would like to know more information about this issue.  </td>

Lampbrush chromosomes were commonly found in amphibians; whereas, Polytene chromosomes were known to be specialized chromosomes  found in Drosophila. Polytene chromosomes were found to be replicated innumerable times, but fail to undergo cell division which results in the large size of the Polytene chromosomes. Furthermore, since the staining patterns indicated that these specialized forms of chromosomes are highly composed of euchromatin, the multiple copies allow an increase in protein production through gene expression of the multiple genes. These Polytene chromosomes enabled researchers to determine certain banding patterns within the Polytene chromosomes as well allowed a structure of chromatin in Eukayotes to be noticed and constructed. These banding patterns provided further confirmation to two notions. The first being that all the cells within an organism contain the same genome or carry the entire set of chromosomes, but gene expression and regulation allows for cell differentiation. The second important thing enabled by specific banding patterns was the ability to notice certain gene mutations with ease such as translocations and frame-shift mutations. </td>

                    <td>When staining chromosomes, two methods-- C banding and G banding, can be used. These banding techniques produce banding patterns that are unique for each chromosome. G-banding, in my opinion, is more useful than C-banding in the sense that more information can be told from the band patterns in G-banding especially in the scenario of a genetic disease. These banding patterns are dependent upon if the gene is highly transcribed or rarely transcribed; the genes that are highly transcribed are known as euchromatin since the gene is able to produce an actual element (amino acid), whereas, those genes that are never transcribed are heterochromatin and cannot produce an amino acid in regular circumstances. The centromeres of chromosomes are shown to be highly composed of heterochromatin since the centromere region is stained darkly with the Giemsa stain which is indicated in C-banding. </td>

However, I am interested in if the nucleus expands to accommodate the increase in the size of Polytene chromosomes and if these chromosomes can be linked to any disorders in the case of mutations within a Polytene chromosome.

I am also curious as to how these chromosomes manage to replicate in the S phase of interphase but fail to go through mitosis, essentially what mechanism is allowing this process to occur. This topic is of high interest to me since like a few other topics, I have more questions regarding the topic than explanations. Furthermore, I am assuming that determining the presence of a mutation would be simpler due to the noticeable difference in banding patterns between a mutant strand and a non-mutant strand; thus, one can determine what is the effect of one mutation in this specialized Polytene chromosome. </td>

I am
just curious as to how that stain binds and shows a euchromatin site or a heterochromatin site on a chromosome. I am interested in finding out if the stain binds to particular molecule found prevalent in heterochromatin or if the stain is placed in equivalent amounts, but those genes that undergo transcription somehow decrease the pigmentation of the stain with each process of transcription for that particular area similar to that of a gradient process. Furthermore, I understand that  C-banding allowed individuals to see that the centromere region is highly heterochromatic, but I do not know but do wish to know what roles do heterochromatic regions play. For instance, we know that the centromere is highly composed of heterochromatin but the centromere plays a key role during cell division.

                    <td>DNA replication within Eukaryotes is much more complex than DNA replication in prokaryotes from the number of enzymes and proteins that play a role within DNA replication and the process of replication itself. For instance in Eukaryotes, an enzyme called Helicase unzips the DNA strand into its two components which will later be called the leading strand (5&#039; to 3&#039; direction) and the lagging strand (3&#039; to 5&#039; direction). The leading strand has continuous synthesis of the DNA complementary base pairs which is accomplished by various DNA polymerase and an RNA primer; whereas the lagging strand is discontinuous. This discontinuous synthesis produces Okazaki Fragments which require multiple RNA primers and DNA polymerases to attach complementary base pairs in fractions leaving spaces in between the complementary bases which is sealed by another enzyme called ligase. In prokaryotes, however, a replication fork is formed at the point of origin and single-stranded binding proteins (SSBP) like that in Eukaryotes keeps the DNA held separated instead of rejoining immediately after the un-fastening of the DNA strand. While the prokaryotic Helicase is unwinding or unraveling the DNA, a portion becomes supercoiled. Furthermore, DNA replication in prokaryotes is also bi-directional as well; however, a major difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the number of origin of initiation or ORI. Prokaryotes have only one while eukaryotes can have multiple ORI which creates an ease at replicating DNA since Eukaryotes have much more DNA than Prokaryotes. </td>

                    <td>The essential problem with linear chromosomes is that they tend to shorten over time as replication occurs over and over.  This is due to the 5&#039; end being shorter on the daughter strand and the 3&#039; end hanging over.  The excess DNA strand becomes digested, thus shortening the DNA.  Telomeres protect the ends of the DNA by providing random copies of bases to protect essential coding DNA from being degraded.  A biological phenomenon linked to this is aging.  If the shortening of DNA can be reversed or stopped, then aging can be curbed to be much slower than it is.</td>

The telomerase enzyme attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary RNA bases are added on the 3&#039; end of the DNA. Once the lagging strand is elongated by telomerase, DNA polymerase can add to the ends of the chromosomes and the telomeres are replicated. This 5&#039; to 3&#039; replication is seen in eukaryotes because DNA cannot be replicated 3&#039; to 5&#039; so the cell must have mechanisms to make up for this.

The solution to this is telomeres which are long sequences at the end of the DNA strand. A problem with telomeres is that they become shorter after replication and the shortening becomes more severe with each generation. The solution to this is the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is able to lengthen the telomeres which essentially eliminates the shortening of the telomeres. </td>

                    <td>DNA replication occurs within a cell in preparation for cell division to try to make sure that the new cells that are formed have the exact copy of genetic material from the parent cell. The differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA replication are largely related to contrasts in size and complexity of the DNA and cells of these organisms. The average eukaryotic cell has 25 times more DNA than a prokaryotic cell. In prokaryotic cells, there is only one point of origin, replication occurs in two opposing directions at the same time, and takes place in the cell cytoplasm. Eukaryotic cells on the other hand, have multiple points of origin, and use unidirectional replication within the nucleus of the cell. </td>
