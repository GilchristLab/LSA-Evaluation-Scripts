If that is truly the case, there is not going to be much information on the test, and everyone should do splendidly.

I don&#039;t, however, feel like I have the same hold on the idea of microsatellites and their applications. I have a basic understanding, that microsatellites are tandem repeats of base pairs and the number of repeats gives us insight about which organisms are more closely related. I am not sure that my understanding goes much further than that though, so I should definitely take some time to read up on microsatellites. </td>

For instance, a parent who is heterozygous for two traits in a cis configuration and is crossed with a homozygous recessive parent for those two traits, then the offspring would have to be either the wild type for those traits or homozygous recessive for the traits if no crossing over occurs. In the course of crossing over occurring, it is easy to detect where the change in alleles occurred if we know the configuration of the parents and the children&#039;s genotype. The crossing over in a trans configuration would result in the same as the noncrossover heterozygous parent. In addition, in order to detremine the gene that was swapped, the order of the genes must be correct. In the case of a double crossover the swapped allele must be in the middle because the two crossovers result in keeping the outside genes in their initial locus. For two genes, however, it does not matter. </td>

In addition, the ability to isolate a gene of interest for further research has always been fasciating to me, so the ability to isolate a gene or watch the expression of a particular gene in three traits (double crossover occurs) is only possible if the correct order of alleles are determined. </td>
