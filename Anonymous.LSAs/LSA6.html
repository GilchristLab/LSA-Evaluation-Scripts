I understand what gene pools are and how they can change base on my explanation.

The conditions are the following: no mutation, no migration or immigration, no selection,  random mating, and an infinitely large population. These conditions correspond to ideal results in which allele frequencies of both the dominant and recessive allele will remain constant overtime throughout generations. This concept can also be used for sex linked genes but with a slight variation. If the Hardy Weinberg law is discredited through the violation of at least one condition that was earlier stated, then the population(s) is left subject to evolutionary influences (both micro-evolution and macro-evolution) which results in variation from one population to the next. These evolutionary factors include mutation, gene flow, genetic drift and even speciation, thus, creating differentiation a between populations.  This law consists of two equations that can be used to calculate frequencies of an allele or the frequencies of homozygous dominant and recessive and heterozygotes. </td>

Yet, this law is used to create assumptions of an ideal population or to apply the results to a non-ideal or real populations since at least one condition, if not more, is violated. This notion intrigues me since I understand  the use for this principle logically, but the fact that reality always overcomes ideality in terms of the Hardy Weinberg Law. Furthermore in reality since one condition is at least defied, that means evolutionary processes do occur that do change the allele frequencies throughout generations within a population and amongst other populations. These evolutionary processes include mutation, gene flow caused by migration or immigration, or even genetic drift such as the bottleneck effect and can change the alleles frequencies over time through random and non-random means. </td>

For Hardy Weinberg equilibrium the population would have to mate randomly and have no migration in or out of the gene pool. So when a population is not in equilibrium this could be an assumption that fails. If that is true then the migration of people from one population to another would provide either an increase or decrease in genetic diversity depending on the direction of migration. It is important as a population to be genetically diverse because then it is easier to adapt to inevitable changes.</td>

The inheritance of certain alleles is what allows some of the population to survive and reproduce while others die.
