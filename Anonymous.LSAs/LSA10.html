                    <td>In 1944, Avery, McCarty and MacLeod published the results of their studies that concluded, definitively, that DNA was the “fundamental unit of the transforming principle”, meaning that they had shown that it was, in fact, DNA that was the source of the necessary information that cells needed to gain new genes or the ability to produce new gene products. Their work established that the transforming principle that had been hypothesized and much sought to explain was DNA. They showed this using virulent cells that they then killed with heat, and after processing to mix and destroy any remaining living aspects of the virulent cells, introduced the left over material to avirulent cells. This “left over” material after the destruction of the virulent cells themselves was then shown to be able to induce transformation in avirulent cells, making them virulent. They also further controlled for possible contamination or combining factors by adding more digestive enzymes to absolutely destroy any RNA, but the transformation still occurred. The only way to prevent the transformation was found to be after the use of a DNA digesting enzyme, which destroyed the DNA. These results established DNA as the “active factor” that was responsible for the effects of transformation.  </td>

                    <td>Following the studies performed and published by Avery, McCarty, and MacLeod, the Hershey-Chase experiments introduced yet another convincing piece of evidence that implicated DNA as being the genetic material of cells. Using Escherichia coli and bacteriophage T2, they were able to show that when the virus infected a cell, it was the DNA of the virus that was injected into the bacterial cell, not the associated proteins. They were able to show this because DNA has phosphorous, but not sulfur and proteins have sulfur but not phosphorous. By using radioisotopes of phosphorous and sulfur, Hershey and Chase were able to isolate the location of the viral DNA and proteins after infection of the bacteria. They found that the radiolabeled phosphorous was the only material that was present in an infected bacterial cell, and that the associated viral proteins (termed “ghosts”) were left outside the cell. This implicated that it’s the DNA of the virus that can take over the machinery of the bacterial cell, using the bacteria itself to reproduce and create more viral progeny. </td>

                    <td>Erwin Chargaff established that there was a relationship in the proportions of the concentration between A and T and G and C. The three most important aspects of Chargaff’s findings were that the amount of adenine residues is proportional to the amount of thymine residues, and that the amount of guanine residues is proportional to the amount of cytosine residues. They also found that the sum of the adenine and guanine residues equaled the sum of the cytosine and thymine residues. Lastly, they established that the percentage of the guanine/cytosine pairings don’t have to equal the percentage of the adenine/thymine pairings. Using this crucial information, Watson and Crick created a model for the structure of DNA that included seven major important aspects. Watson and Crick hypothesized that DNA is made of two long polynucleotide chains that coil to form a double helix, that these chains are antiparallel, that the chains are “stacked”, each turn of the helix is 3.4 nm long, that major and minor grooves appear because of the base paining, the double helix has 2.0 nm diameter, and, most importantly, that the nitrogenous bases described by Chargaff were paired as a result of hydrogen bonds. This last aspect of their model was crucial to its development, and was made possible using the established relationships Chargaff had already described. The hydrogen bonding is important because the structure of adenine and thymine create two hydrogen bonds, and guanine and cytosine form three hydrogen bonds. Because of these structural differences, the bases pair, creating major and minor grooves in the double helix. While some small changes has been made to their model because of more recent discoveries, the major of the Watson and Crick model remains intact to this day.</td>

Avery, McCarty and MacLeod used the work conducted by Fredrick Griffith, where he proposed that there must be some “transforming principle” contained in cells. In the present, bacteriophages and infecting viruses are a major concern in medicine, but also hold promise in having potential therapeutic benefits. Some of these benefits could include using a virus to inject genetic material that could compensate for a disease causing deficiency of an individual’s natural cells.</td>

                    <td>I understand that the Hershey-Chase experiments took the current understanding of the mechanism of a virus to the next level. Before their experiments, I understand that it was known that T-even bacteriophages had their own DNA, a protein coat, and tail fibers. They knew that the genetic material from the phage was somehow transferred to the bacterial cell, where many more progeny phages were made, and then released at the expense of the death of the bacteria. I understand that the Hershey-Chase experiments were significant because they shed light on the mechanism that the phages used to accomplish this life cycle. By showing that that it was the DNA of the phage that was inserted into the bacteria, but none of the proteins of the phage coat, they showed that it was actually the phage DNA that could take over the machinery of the cell and use it to create copies of itself. This is important because it was still unclear how phages could reproduce, since they themselves lack the organelles and machinery to reproduce on their own.</td>

Because of the proportional relationship that had already been established in previous research, Watson and Crick were able to extrapolate the base-pairing model, and use known factors such as hydrogen bonding and the need for major and minor grooves to create a stable double helix with varying size nitrogen base pairs. I understand that even though this model was published over 50 years ago, only minor correction or changes have been made to this model as new imaging and laboratory techniques have been discovered and utilized. </td>

The work that Frederick Griffith performed is now regarded as the earliest studies in transformation, and he was able just to show that there was some mechanism by which genetic information could be passed from one cell to the next. I understand that he looked at the morphology after being exposed to virulent and avirulent cells. I understand that he found that injecting mice with heat-killed virulent cells (not harmful) and living avirulent cells (not harmful) actually resulted in the death of the mice. This was a shocking discovery, and one that led him to suggest that there must have been a transfer of genetic information from the dead virulent cells to the living avirulent cells—transforming the avirulent cells into virulent cells with the capacity to kill.</td>

I found that the most comprehensive way for me to retain the information presented in this course is to take notes in lecture, and then take separate notes from the book. I have implemented these outside resources such as various online video resources and PDF files of concept explanations and practice problems/activities posted via other universities. The hardest part for me is understanding the physics and the organic chemistry elements of the reasoning (such as why a left-handed helix won&#039;t work). While I don&#039;t fully understand the specifics behind the &quot;why&quot; of all the postulates, I think I have a firm grasp of the understanding behind the aspects of the model that pertain the most to this course.

The group of scientists isolated large quantities of type IIIS virulent cells. These cells were centrifuged, collected, and heat killed. Following homogenization and several extractions with the detergent deoxycholate, the researchers obtained a soluble filtrate that retained the ability to induce transformation of type IIR avirulent cells. Protein was removed from the filtrate and polysaccharides were digested and removed. Precipitation with ethanol yielded a fibrous mass that still retained the ability to induce transformation of type IIR avirulent cells. Testing proved that the transforming principle was DNA. This was proven when the enzyme deoxyribonuclease destroyed the transforming activity of the filtrate, since this enzyme can break down DNA.</td>

Thus, when the phages infected a cell and transmitted their information into the cell, they could tell what was carrying important information based off which isotope was present in the cell. The results of this experiment showed that the phosphorous labeled DNA was present in the bacterial cell following adsorption while the sulfur labeled protein remained outside the bacterial cell. This suggested that DNA is what carries genetic information since it is what was transferred to the cell.</td>

I understand that the enzymes were used to see which molecule digestion results in the loss of ability to harm the mice, but I am confused as to why they are looking at the presence of only R strains or both S and R strains to determine whether the enzyme harmed the molecule.</td>

Although the results were not conclusive, and Hershey and Chase were cautious in their interpretation, previous, contemporaneous and subsequent discoveries all served to prove that DNA is the hereditary material.

They then used that strain   enzymes that destroyed proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and other molecules, including the nucleic acid RNA and injected it in a mouse. Transformation still occurred. However, the molecules had been damaged, they were not responsible for the transformation. Avery and the other researchers repeated the experiment, this time using enzymes that would break down DNA. When they destroyed the nucleic acid DNA in the extract, transformation did not occur. There was just one possible conclusion. DNA was the transforming factor. Avery and other scientists discovered that the nucleic acid DNA stores and transmits the genetic information from one generation of an organism to the next.</td>

They saw the paper from Linus Pauling, who proposed that DNA had a triplex helix structure, but it was wrong, since phosphorus are very negative so they would ripple each other and due to this they would break apart the DNA strand. However, using the data from Rosalind Franklin they were able to figure out that it was a double helix and not triple helix and they also figured out that the phosphate group lied outside the DNA structure.  However, after looking at Erwin Chargaff data of A and T and C and G always forming a complementary pair, they were able to figure out the exact structure of the DNA double helix.  Since the nitrogenous base pairs and are stable compared to negatively charged phosphorus they were able to eventually figure that DNA was a double helix and not triple helix. </td>

Rough strain doesn&#039;t have the capsule and is therefore killed off by the immune system of the mouse, allowing the mouse to survive. In addition to that he heat shocked the s strain, killing it, and injected it into the mouse. It survived. He then heat shocked the s strain and added it to the r strain and injected it into the mouse. The mouse died. This is because although the s strain was no longer virulent, it still contained the genes for the capsule, which was picked up (transformed) by the r strain, creating more bacteria with the capsules.  </td>

He added that to the model, so that matching base pairs interlocked in the middle of the double helix to keep the distance between the chains constant.

Watson and Crick showed that each strand of the DNA molecule was a template for the other. During cell division the two strands separate and on each strand a new &quot;other half&quot; is built, just like the one before.

The labeled phages and unlabeled bacteria were then mixed and once the adsorption complexes were formed, they were immediately isolated. The bacteria and phages were separated and examined.

He expected for this combination to have no effect on the mice because neither alone would kill the mice but instead, all the mice that had received this combination died shortly with their blood work showing that the virulent bacterium was in the bloodstream. The avirulent bacteria undergoing spontaneous mutation was ruled out so this meant that some sort of interaction had taken place between the living avirulent cells and the heat killed virulent cells. Griffith concluded that the heat killed bacteria has somehow converted the avirulent bacteria and called this transformation. Other scientists went further went Griffith’s work and showed that it was possible in vitro and this all went to show that some substance was responsible for the change.</td>

He also found that the sum of the A and G residues equaled the sum of the C and T residues, but the percentage of A/T pairings don&#039;t necessarily equal the G/C pairings. Watson and Crick used Chargaff&#039;s findings to create a model for the structure of DNA. They hypothesized that DNA was made of two long polynucleotide chains that coil to form a double helix. The chains run antiparallel and are &quot;stacked&quot; on top of each other, each turn of the helix is 3.4 nm long, and the helix is 2.0 nm wide. There are major and minor grooves that appear due to base pairing. They also hypothesized that the bases described by Chargaff were paired by hydrogen bonds. Their model still stays in tact today, with a few small changes.</td>

the acceptance of DNA as the genetic material. Their work was the first direct experimental proof that DNA is the biomolecule responsible for heredity, no proteins. They ran experiments on several strains of pneumonia bacterium, some virulent and some avirulent. The difference depended on the polysaccharide capsule around the bacterial.  The Virulent had the capsule and the avirulent did not.  Virulent bacteria were not easily
engulfed, so they multiplied and caused pneumonia.</td>

T2. The virus consisted of a protein coat surrounding DNA. They knew that the phage’s external structure was
composed of a hexagonal head and a tail. The phage adsorbs to the bacterial
cell, and then some genetic component of the phage enters the bacterial cell. Following infection, the viral component takes over the host and causes viral
reproduction. In a reasonably short time, many new phages are made. The bacterial cell is then lysed, which releases the progeny viruses. This is known as the lytic cycle. This helped prove that DNA was the genetic material because the virus DNA was copied and spread.</td>

four bases. This data was critical to the success of Watson and Crick, as they came up with the double helical model of DNA. The amount of adenine residues
is proportional to the amount of thymine residues, and the amount of guanine residues is proportional to the amount of cytosine residues. The data provided the initial clue to the DNA puzzle for Watson and Crick. When fibers of a DNA molecule are subjected to X-ray
bombardment, the X rays scatter in a pattern that
depends on the molecule’s atomic structure. The pattern of diffraction can be captured as spots on photographic film and analyzed for clues to the overall shape of and regularities within the molecule. Rosalind Franklin obtained X-ray data from purified samples of DNA, which suggested that the structure of DNA was some sort of helix. However, she did not propose a definitive model and her work was wrongfully given and used by Watson and Crick.</td>

The use of enzymes to breakdown lipids, RNA/DNA, proteins and carbohydrates allowed the researchers to determine if the process of transformation was still occurring.

The radioactive sulfur labels the proteins because of the formation of disulfide bonds during the tertiary structure of proteins and the radioactive phosphorous labels the DNA strand due to the phosphate sugar backbones present. Once the bacteriophages were given ample time to infect bacteria, the mixture of the cells and the bacteriophages were then centrifuged. The centrifuged results showed that the pellets contained radioactive phosphorous inside the bacterial cell while the radioactive sulfur was found simply floating closer to the top which became the supernatant. This fascinating experiment was conducted multiple times and supported that DNA was in fact the hereditary material in bacteriophages. </td>

They were able to construct a DNA model that was anti-parallel, double helix with the nitrogenous bases on the interior due to their hydrophobic tendencies and the phosphate sugar backbone facing on the outside due to their hydrophilic nature. Chargaff came about an astounding phenomena that later became to be known as Chargaff&#039;s Rules. These rules state that the proportion of adenine to thymine is almost equivalent and the proportion of guanine to cytosine is almost equivalent, but the proportions of adenine and thymine to guanine and cytosine is not necessarily equivalent. Furthermore, he determined that different species had variations in the proportions of these 4 nitrogenous bases. However, Rosalind Franklin&#039;s story contrasts highly from Chargaff in the sense that she was not able to publish her findings. Franklin specialized in X-Ray crystallography patterns which helped her determined the properties of the DNA molecule from the width to the length of the DNA in Angstroms. Her famous image (Picture 31) showed that DNA was a double helix with a phosphate sugar backbone on the exterior and the nitrogenous bases connected on the interior. Her work was shared with Watson and Crick without her attention, thus she did not get any accreditation on her work until years later. </td>

                    <td>Fredrick Griffith&#039;s experiment with smooth and rough strains of pneumonia is well known since this experiment was the first to show bacterial transformation. The rough strand was as avirulent strand of the disease whereas the smooth strand which had a protective coat was highly virulent thus causing the disease. Griffith inserted the following: a live S strain in the mouse which resulted in the mouse to die, a live R strain which kept the mouse alive, a heat killed S strain which also resulted in the survival of the mice, and his control, which changed everything, he injected a mouse with a heat killed S strain and alive R strain. To his dismay, he was able to find alive strand S within the heart of the mouse; thus, indicating some external process that &quot;revived&quot; the virulent S strain that was initially heat killed. After researching, Griffith determined that there is some uptake of external source of DNA which he claimed to be transformation. I find this experiment very interesting and possibly one of my favorite experiment that was conducted in the mid 1900s. I understood in lecture that the protein coat was not the cause of virulency of avirulency, instead it is the way the immune response recognizes and attacks that pathogen. The rough strain is easily detectable and is destroyed thus inhibiting the arise of pneumonia, but the protein coat on the smooth strain somehow is able to provide extra protection from the destruction of the bacteria as a result of the immune system&#039;s response. The fact that the smooth strain are less susceptible to being annihilated before infection, these strains are the ones that cause Pneumonia rather than the R strain. </td>

By destroying each macromolecule in each group, the tea searchers were able to conclude that DNA is the source of genetic information and not lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins.

Therefore, the bacteria must have exchanged DNA. The only part of the experiment I do not understand is how the heat-killed strain was able to pass genetic material if the heat killed it. Therefore, I plan to look up more about the experiment and better understand what the text meant by heat-killed and how the DNA was passed. </td>

Bacteria of the R (rough) strain lack a capsule and are nonpathogenic. To test for the trait of pathogenicity, Griffith injected mice with the two strains. He concluded that the living R bacteria had been transformed into pathogenic S bacteria by an unknown, heritable substance from the dead S cells that allowed the R cells to make capsules. Only when DNA was allowed to remain active did transformation occur. Through this experiment we were able to conclude that DAN was the hereditary material </td>

Griffith, a British medical officer, had spent years applying serological typing to cases of pneumonia, a frequently fatal disease in the early 20th century. He found that multiple types—some virulent and some non-virulent—were often present over the course of a clinical case of pneumonia, and thought that one type might change into another (rather than simply multiple types being present all along). In testing that possibility, he found that transformation could occur when dead bacteria of a virulent type and live bacteria of a non-virulent type were both injected in mice: the mice would develop a fatal infection (normally only caused by live bacteria of the virulent type) and die, and virulent bacteria could be isolated from such infected mice.
