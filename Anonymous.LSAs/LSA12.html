The third difference is that eukaryotes have nucleosomes, which are structures of histone proteins that clump together and compact the DNA in the strand (also turn off genes in clumped region). The fourth difference is that eukaryotes use two different polymerases to copy the leading and lagging strands (versus only one polymerase in prokaryotes). The fifth difference is found during initiation of transcription in that in eukaryotes, there is primer RNA that is then converted in DNA and in prokaryotes there is just an RNA primer.</td>

This code is passed on in three bases groupings called codons. Ribosomes in the cytoplasm read the mRNA strands three base pairs at a time (open-reading frame), and tRNA carries the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome to be added to the growing polypeptide chain. These codons are degenerate, in that one amino acid can be represented by more than one codon (three base grouping) sequence.</td>

I’m confused because it seems like if it was regulating a process in the cell, it would have to sometimes be present and sometimes not be, or sometimes promote transcription or sometimes shut it down. I don’t understand how this consistent sequence could be a true mechanism of regulation. </td>

I have tried to find various resources that have explanations of the mechanism of regulation performed by the promoter sequence. I&#039;ve also used resources such as the mastering genetics activities that come with the textbook, as well as re-reading the textbook sections pertaining to this week&#039;s lesson. I found that the most comprehensive way for me to retain the information presented in this course is to take notes in lecture, and then take separate notes from the book. I have implemented these outside resources such as various online video resources and PDF files of concept explanations and practice problems/activities posted via other universities. The hardest part for me is understanding how and why these promoter sequences function and are necessary, beyond just the fact that scientific investigation has shown that they are necessary. I plan to meet with my classmates in a study group and hopefully they can help me understand more fully this concept.

In eukaryotes, transcription begins when the TBP, or TATA Binding Protein, and the Transcription factor II-D bind to the TATA box and form a complex for RNA Polymerase to come in.

In prokaryotes, abortive initiation continues to occur until an RNA product of a threshold length of approximately 10 nucleotides is synthesized, at which point promoter escape occurs and a transcription elongation complex is formed. The σ factor is released according to a stochastic model. Mechanistically, promoter escape occurs through a scrunching mechanism, where the energy built up by DNA scrunching provides the energy needed to break interactions between RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the promoter.
In eukaryotes, after several rounds of 10nt abortive initiation, promoter clearance coincides with the TFIIH&#039;s phosphorylation of serine 5 on the carboxy terminal domain of RNAP II, leading to the recruitment of capping enzyme .

I&#039;m eukaryotes, different RNA Polymerases have different jobs or functions associated with them. RNA Polymerase 2 which is used to create mRNA requires Transcription Factors such as TFIID and TBD (TATA binding proteins) to first attach to the promoter region. Once the RNA Polymerase II is attached to the pre-initiation complex, transcription can begin once the tail of Polymerase has been phosphorylated by the TFIID protein. In addition, there are suppressors and enhancers that can also regulate the transcription process by determining if there is a change in environment via signals that may require an increase of a decrease in certain proteins ( therefore, more or less mRNA transcripts to allow for the increase or decrease in protein requirement).</td>

Another difference can be noted in the initiation of the transcription process itself, prokaryotes require a core enzyme composed of multiple constant subunits a specific variable subunit called sigma to form a holoenzyme. The sigma subunit allows attachment to the promoter region and leaves after a few base pairs are added this leaving the core enzyme to continue and complete the process of transcription. In eukaryotes, however, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter only after TFIID and other TBP such as TFII H,E,F,A, and B bind to the promoter region. This process is complex since TFIID and TFIIA remain at the promoter site while TFIIH, TFIIB, and TFIIE leave as RNA Polymerase II and TFIIF continue to synthesize the mRNA strand. Termination process also has some variances since eukaryotes have a 3&#039; poly-A tail that prokaryotes do not have.  </td>

                    <td>The Central Dogma states that DNA creates RNA which creates protein via the processes of transcription and translation, respectively. Transcription is the process by which a complementary ribonucleotides strand can be composed in a 5&#039; -&gt; 3&#039; direction from a template strand of the DNA strand that runs in the 3&#039;-&gt;5&#039; direction also known as the antisense strand. Transcription can be divided into three divisions or categories in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes-- initiation, elongation, and termination. In prokaryotic initiation a holoenzyme is required to copy the mRNA strand whereas in eukaryotic initiation a DNA polymerase and a few proteins are required. The elongation step refers to the continuous addition of base pairs after the start codon. Finally, the termination step indicates the ending of mRNA ribonucleotides and processing which has certain variances between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, the mRNA strand has to have a 5&#039; methylguanosine cap and a 3&#039; poly A tail to prevent degradation by floating nucleases of the newly synthesized strand as it exits the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. </td>

This ensures precision in the translation process and in the central dogma as a whole. However, a single amino acid can be encoded with multiple codons. I understand that the main point at which the genetic code comes into practice is at the A and E sites in the ribosome. As mRNA is fed through the ribosome, tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the A site.

Prokaryotes don&#039;t require extensive remodeling or nearly as many transcriptional factors to initiate transcription. Prokaryotic transcription and translation both in the cytosol. Eukaryotic transcription occurs separately in the nucleus, thus is it a delayed process getting from transcription to translation.  However, transcription and translation is nearly simultaneous in prokaryotes. Eukaryotes also have many post-transcriptional modifications, which include the addition of a 5&#039; 7-methyl-guanosine cap and a 3&#039; poly-A tail. All of this occurs before the mRNA is transferred to the cytosol for translation by the ribosome.</td>

Unlike the prokaryote process, in eukaryotes the RNA transcript is not free to associate with ribosomes prior to the completion of transcription. For the mRNA to be translated, it must move out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Initiation of transcription of eukaryotic genes requires the compact chromatin fiber, characterized by nucleosome coiling, to be uncoiled and the DNA to be made accessible to RNA polymerase and other regulatory proteins. </td>

                    <td>Transcription between eukaryotes and prokaryotes differs in very fundamental ways. First, transcription in eukaryotes occurs within the nucleus. Three different RNA polymerase forms are involved with this transcription. Unlike in prokaryotes, eukaryotic RNA transcripts cannot associate with ribosomes before transcription is completed. Also, eukaryotic chromatin fibers have to uncoil in order for the DNA to be accessible to RNA polymerase for transcription. Prokaryotic DNA doesn’t not form chromatin. Also, eukaryotic transcription produces RNA that has to be processed before it can leave the nucleus and begin translation. This includes, addition of a 5’cap and poly a tail and splicing.</td>

During translation, each codon can code for a single amino acid, which can be subsequently linked together via phosphodiester bonds. Therefore the genetic code  found in DNA that is transcribed into mRNA molecules which are then translated into proteins concluding the central dogma.</td>
