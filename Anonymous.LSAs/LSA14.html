I also understand why when sufficient gene products are available, ribosomes read through the sequence, which releases RNA polymerase from the DNA.

                    <td>Gene regulation in eukaryotes is more complex than regulation in prokaryotes in a variety of ways. Many of these differences are due to the fact that eukaryotic DNA is much large than prokaryotic DNA, and because of this, eukaryotic organisms have had to develop mechanisms to  compensate or work with their large DNA. One difference between gene regulation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that in eukaryotes, RNA polymerase doesn’t recognize the promoter sequence itself, but rather the transcription factor proteins that recognize and bind the promoter sequence (TATA box) recruit the RNA polymerase after they have bound to the sequence. Another aspect of the differences between gene regulation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that prokaryotic systems are more adept at responding to the environment around them. Unlike in eukaryotes which have stable mechanisms of maintaining homeostasis, prokaryotes are sensitive to their environment and respond more quickly and directly to outside stimuli.</td>

A chromosome is considered “silenced” when it is packed in such a way that transcription macherinery cannot get to the gene sequences in the DNA wrapped around the histones, and this wrapping and packing is regulated by enzymes that can either use Acetylation or deacetylation of nucleosome tails to silence or turn back on a gene.</td>

The human body alone has something like 200 different cell types--each performing a different function. This function is dictated by what genes are being expressed.

Second, eukaryotes tend to be much larger than prokaryotes. Stimuli sensed at one part of a eukaryotic body must be relayed to other cells in order for the organism to respond properly (homeostasis). This entails the need for more complex regulatory mechanisms involving hormones and other signaling molecules that must travel long distances quickly. </td>

Histone acetylation and deacetylation are essential parts of gene regulation. These reactions are typically catalysed by enzymes with &quot;histone acetyltransferase&quot; (HAT) or &quot;histone deacetylase&quot; (HDAC) activity. Acetylation is the process where an acetyl functional group is transferred from one molecule (in this case, Acetyl-Coenzyme A) to another.

One reason is that the eukaryotic genome is significantly larger than prokaryotes. Eukaryotic DNA is bound by proteins called histones to create nucleosomes. The winding of DNA around the nucleosome core contributes to DNA&#039;s packaging and also effects what genes are read for transcription. Prokaryotes lack such techniques to organize their DNA making them less complex.

This helps the chromatin conformations open up and allows for the binding of transcription regulatory proteins to DNA. Meanwhile, deacetylation would do the opposite. Histone deacetylase enzymes remove acetate groups from histone tails which will increase the negative charge on the histone and lead to increased affinity of the histone for the DNA. This makes the chromatin recondense and be unavailable for transcription.</td>

I understand that two of the largest differences stem from the fact that eukaryotic mRNA must be transported outside of the nucleus before translation can occur and the fact that eukaryotic DNA has introns, which must be excised from the mRNA before translation. In post-transcriptional processing, the mRNA can be spliced in many different ways, resulting in many different gene products. Additionally, the addition of caps and polyadenylation increases the half-life of mRNA, but variation in the half-life can act as a regulatory mechanism. Another area of eukaryotic gene regulation is chromatin remodeling, which exercises control on which genes are accessible to transcription factors and RNA polymerase. Lastly, the way in which proteins are folded is another regulatory mechanism. </td>

One example of this mechanism occurs in the tryptophan operon. When tRNA with tryptophan is readily available, the ribosome moves quickly through tryptophan codons in the leader sequence. This prevents the mRNA from forming a terminator hairpin, and transcription (as well as translation) occurs unimpaired. When tRNA with tryptophan is not readily available, however, the ribosome stalls on the tryptophan codons, allowing the mRNA to form a terminator hairpin. This signals RNA polymerase to terminate transcription, resulting in no new protein product. I understand that this process is called attenuation, and it is used to prevent unnecessary production of proteins which are already available. </td>

However, in eukaryotes the transcription occurs in nucleus and translation occurs in cytoplasm. Therefore, the process of finish and producing a complete stable mRNA in nucleus and then sending it outside in the cytoplasm makes it little more complex than prokarytoes. If there is a problem when mRNA is being transcribed or being send to the cytoplasm an person can have various unknown disease. Moreover, if the translation is not taken care of carefully as well then the person can have various disease. For example, if a protein that is posttranslationally modified in eukaryotes is not converted to its end protien or final protein than a person can become mentally retarded. For example, tyrosin not being converted to phenylalanine cause mental retardation. </td>

When insufficient gene product is available, the ribosomes stall, a different secondary pairing of mRNA occurs and formation of an intrinsic terminator is prevented.

Translational-attenuation is characterized by the misfolding of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The Shine-Dalgarno sequence, responsible for ribosomal binding to allow proper translation, is inaccessible because it is folded into a hairpin-loop structure, thus, translation cannot occur. Transcriptional-attenuation is characterized by the presence of an attenuator within the DNA sequence that results in formation of mRNA-stem loops that prevent further transcription from occurring.

If there is a mutation in which the repressor cannot bind the operator, then transcription will always be on.

Attenuation involves a short leader sequence with areas of complementary base pairing. When sufficient gene product (amino acids and thus tRNAs for those amino acids) is available, ribosomes read through the leader sequence which allows formation of an intrinsic terminator and releases RNA polymerase from the DNA. When insufficient gene product is available, the ribosomes stall, a different secondary pairing of mRNA occurs and formation of an intrinsic terminator is prevented. RNA polymerase reads through the operon structural genes. Attenuation is possible in prokaryotes because transcription and translation occur at the same time on the same mRNA strand.</td>

I know that the regulation of gene expression can happen at any stage, from the DNA uncoiling and binding to transcription factors, at a transcriptional level, posttranscriptional level, translation level, or a post translational level.

Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled at many different places like epigenetics, transcription, post-transcription, translation, and post-translation. Prokaryotic regulation  occurs within the cytoplasm because there is a lack of a nucleus. Eukaryotic gene expression occurs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Regulation can occur at all stages of the process, like when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors.  It can also be regulated when the RNA is transcribed or post-transcription, when RNA is made into proteins, or after the proteins have been made.</td>

The need to prevent unregulated and unnecessary gene expression can be prevented by attenuation, which is characterized as a regulatory mechanism. However, i do not know much about attenuation or how it works. I need to look into this topic more.

The process of attenuation involves the presence of a stop signal that indicates premature termination. The stop signal, referred to as the attenuator, prevents the proper function of the ribosomal complex, stopping the process. The attenuator is transcribed from the appropriate DNA sequence and its effects are dependent on the metabolic environment. In times of need, the attenuator within the mRNA sequence will be bypassed by the ribosome and proper translation will occur. However, if there is not a need for a mRNA molecule to be translated but the process was simultaneously initiated, the attenuator will prevent further transcription and cause a premature termination. Hence, attenuators can function in either transcription-attenuation or translation-attenuation.</td>

Moreover, the folded DNA has to remain accessible for various cellular processes, such as replication and transcription. To achieve this, cells coil DNA around histones.</td>

                    <td>Gene regulation in eukaryotes has been proven to be more complex than regulation in prokaryotes. For starters prokaryotic gene expression is controlled mainly at the transcription level, whereas eukaryotic gene expression includes transcriptional regulation, epigentics, post-transcriptional regulation, and translational, and post-translational regulation. Basically, eukaryotic cells can regulation gene expression at almost any point within the central dogma. Also, prokaryotic gene expression occurs in the cytoplasma whereas eukaryotic gene expression occurs within the nucleus. This difference allows prokaryotic cells to begin translation before trascription has been completed. In eukaryotic cells, transcription is temporally and spatially seperated. Transcription occurs in the nucleus and translation occurs in the cytoplasm at the ribosome. Also, transcription in eukaryotes has to be completed before translation can begin.</td>

The swi-snfi complex binds to both the DNA and the nucleosome but does not do so in a site-specific fashion. When swi-snf is absent, as seen in the mutant eukaryote, mRNA levels are significantly decreased. Basically, the swi-snf complex remodeles chromosomes making genes more accessible for transcription by loosening DNA strands or by reorganizing internal nuclosome components. When this complex is absent, this form of gene regulation is also absent making DNA less capable of being transcribed.</td>

This process involves the addition or removal of an acetyl group to the lysine residues within the N-terminal tails of the nucleosomes that make up histones. This process helps regulate gene expression. Depending on how acetylated or deactylated the histones in a chromosome are. The enzyme responsible for the acetylation of these proteins is HAT, or histone acetyltransferase, and the enzyme responsible for deacetylating these proteins is HDAC, histon deacetylase. Acetylation relaxes and uncondenses chromatin whereas deacetylation recondenses chromatin. When the chromatin is relaxed DNA binding proteins are better able to interact with the genes activating gene transcription.</td>

                    <td>The fact that gene regulation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is vastly different is really pretty interesting to me. I think its really cool that prokaryotes can start translation before transcription is completed. Normally, I feel like with cell processes one has to be completed before the next can start. Also, this concept is important to larger biological phenomenon because the more complex gene regulation found in eukaryotes allows these organisms to be more complex as well. As humans, we are in need of great gene regulation that isnt quite necessary in the more simplistic prokaryotic cells.</td>

Chemical remodeling of nucleosomes is one of the main forms of regulation in epignetics depending on how acetylated or deacetylated parts of a are chromosoms determines which portions of it will be expressed or not expressed. Altered expression and mutations of genes that encode the enzyme HDAC, which deacetylates histones, have been linked to tumor development. Therefore, HDACs can be used as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.</td>

I understand that deacetylation is simply the reverse reaction where an acetyl group is removed from a molecule.

I understand that the non-functional RNA produced prevents proper transcription. I understand that translational-attenuation is characterized by the misfolding of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. I understand rthat the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, responsible for ribosomal binding to allow proper translation, is inaccessible because it is folded into a hairpin-loop structure, thus, translation cannot occur.</td>

During attenuation, the ribosome becomes stalled in the attenuator region in the mRNA leader.

                    <td>There are various reasons as to why gene regulation is much more complex in an eukaryotic organism than a prokaryotic organism. For instance due to the fact that eukaryotes are multi-cellular organisms, they have more DNA in comparison to the prokaryotic or unicellular organisms which requires more extensive packaging of that DNA. Hence, eukaryotic gene regulation deals with removing and re-attaching the histone proteins that allow condensation of the DNA; processes such as acetylation, deacteylation, and methylation are all processes that affect the amount of histone proteins that are wrapped inside DNA thus affecting gene expression. Another difference that results in the complexity of gene regulation in eukaryotes is the fact that transcription and translation do not occur simultaneously since there is a nucleus that holds the chromosomal DNA  (transcription occurs in the nucleus while translation occurs in the cytoplasm).  This causes another level of gene regulation in eukaryotes that is not present in prokaryotes.Therefore, these physiological differences in between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes results in the high level of complexity of gene regulation in eukaryotes.</td>

Furthermore, the since the mutants are deficient in nucleosome repositioning, I am assuming there is either a possibility of hyper-expression or hypo-expression of a particular gene sequence.

                    <td>The processes of acetylation and deacetylation enable the chromosomes to decondense and re-condense thus allowing and increase and a decrease in gene expression, respectively. Acetylation is the process of adding an acetyl group to a histone through the enzyme called histone acetyltransferase or HAT. The addition of an acetyl group (negatively charged) to the positively charged histone protein results in the histone protein to become neutral thus losing its affinity for the negatively charged DNA (Phosphate backbone)and thus allows the unraveling or uncoiling of some of the genetic material from its associated proteins. This process results in an increase in gene expression since there are no histone proteins that condense the genetic material to that extreme as before. On the other hand, deacetylation is a process in which decreases the expression of a gene through the enzyme called Histone deacteyltransferase or Hdac which is the reverse process of what is discussed above. This enzyme removes acetyl groups that are previously attached and allows the re-condensation of the genetic material which then suppresses gene expression and enables the silencing of a gene sequence. In conclusion, the attachment and removal of acetyl groups enables the variation in gene expression of certain gene sequences within the genome of the organism.</td>

The presence of a nucleus inhibits DNA from exiting the organelle thereby not allowing the simultaneous process of transcription and translation as well. Furthermore, gene regulation has multiple &quot;steps&quot; which is found in eukaryotes since it is highly regulated in eukaryotes ( gene regulation sites occur during transcription, post-transcription, during translation, and post-translation and also includes histone modifications); whereas, prokaryotic gene regulation is controlled simply transcritionally.

I am not sure much about this topic since I was absent in lecture since I was sick that day and I could not find anything related to the swi-snf mutants in the version of the textbook that I use. I also tried to look up information about this topic but I was unable to find something that would help me better comprehend this topic. So, there is a lot about this topic that I am unaware of. I do know that the SWI/SNF somehow reorganizes the internal components of nucleosomes which allow the unraveling of the histone protein from its associated DNA sequence. However, I am assuming that this mutant cannot reorganize the internal components of the nucleosome since this statement says that the swi-snf mutant is deficient in nucleosome repositioning.

                    <td>Acetylation and deacteylation are controlled by two enzymes known as HAT (Histone Acetyltransferase)and HDAC (Histone Deacetyltransferase, respectively. In acetylation, acetyl groups are attached to the lysine residues that are commonly found at the tails of nucleosomes. These lysine residues give the histone proteins a positive charge which allows the proteins to wrap around the DNA molecule since the DNA molecule is negatively charged due to the sugar-phosphate backbones. Once the acetyl group is attached to the lysine end of the nucleosome tail, it neutralizes the histone protein with its negative charge. Thus, the nucleosome complex uncoils to a certain extent which allows the DNA sequence to be expressed with an ease since the DNA is not tightly coiled to the protein. However, deacteylation affects chromosome condensation as well by condensing the DNA sequence more which enables the gene sequence to be more silenced in a manner since the DNA is so tightly coiled to the histone proteins which causes a barrier for the process of transcription. Therefore, deacteylation like methylation results in the silencing of DNA sequence. </td>

For instance in the trp operon, attenuation is similar to a fail-safe if the active repressor molecule fails to attach to the operator site when tryptophan levels are high. In this operon, upstream to the functional genes is a leader sequence which codes for four palindromic sequences in which the first and the second region are complementary to each other while the third and fourth region are complementary to each other. The ribosome is able to pass through the first region with ease but as it gets to the second region, it is unable to move past which hinders RNA Polymerase from creating a proper mRNA and a stem loop is formed between the two complementary regions 3 and 4 and a poly U sequence follows the region 4 which acts as an intrinsic terminator which is characteristic in the process of attenuation. This causes the RNA Polymerase to fall off and prematurely terminate the gene sequence since the termination occurs prior to reaching the functional genes. </td>

Reversible histone acetylation and deacetylation are highly regulated processes that are crucial for chromatin reorganization and the regulation of gene transcription in response to extracellular conditions. The balance between the acetylation and deacetylation of histones serves as a key regulatory mechanism for gene expression and governs numerous developmental processes and disease states.</td>
