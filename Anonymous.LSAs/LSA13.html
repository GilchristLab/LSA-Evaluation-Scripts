He labeled what we now know to be genes are “unit factors” and what we now know as enzymes he called “ferments.” Garrod’s work, like many other brilliant scientists before him, was far ahead of his time, and he was only recognized for the importance of his work almost 30 years later.</td>

After using X-rays to increase the mutation rate in Neurospora crassa, they used a series of minimal plating techniques supplemented with various molecules and nutrients in the biochemical pathway of tyrosine. They concluded that each of the mutants lacked an enzyme in the pathway, and therefore, when the induced mutations affected one gene that was responsible for one enzyme, the culture could not grow unless supplemented by the end product of the missing enzyme in the pathway.</td>

Thus later the one gene one hypothesis was modified to one gene one polypetide hypotheis. Also looking a sickle cell anemia it can be seen that due to just chang in glutamate to valenie the functional of the haemoglobin totally changes and then based on further research, researcher were able to prove that one gene transcribes one polypetide.  Additonally, some genes also encoded non enzyme proteins and polypeptide chains. It is now known that some genes code for various types of RNA involved in protien synthesis as well. </td>

But late on the hypothesis was changed to one gene-one polypeptide hypothesis as not all protein are enzymes. each gene would be responsible for the enzyme facilitating a single step in a metabolic process.

This was found by using starch gel electrophoresis in which HbA migrated farther than HbS, suggesting that its net negative charge was greater. The fingerprinting technique demonstrated HbA and HbS hemoglobins differ by a single peptide fragment. Further analysis then revealed a single amino acid change: Valine was substituted for glutamic acid at the sixth position of beta chain.  </td>

The fluctuation test used T1 bacteriophage and E. coli cells.  Mutations can occur in E. coli cells that make the cells resistant to T1.  If mutations occur adaptively there would be constant probability of acquiring a mutation.  This was not seen, although.  Mutations were random and occurred spontaneously.  </td>

I thought that because it was in the same overall process it would result in the same disease. So at first it was hard for me to really understand, but after going over it in the book and re looking at the lecture slides I have a better understanding as to why.</td>

Later in their life, individuals with the disease develop arthritis with brown pigmentation in the effected joint cartilage/connective tissue. Garrod followed the inheritance of the disease, observing that it followed an autosomal recessive pattern, and postulated that it was caused by a mutation in a gene encoding an enzyme involved in the metabolism of a class of compounds called alkapton. Over the next decade he developed an understanding of the possible nature of inherited diseases of metabolism, specializing in the nature of recessive inheritance of enzyme defects. Garrod expanded his metabolic studies to cover cystinuria, pentosuria, and albinism, and in 1923 he summarized these studies in an expanded edition of his best known work.</td>

In 1949, it was proposed that sickling was caused by a single gene mutation, which was heterozygous in sickle cell trait individuals and homozygous in individuals with full sickle cell anemia. Simultaneously, it was also noted that the hemoglobin from normal individuals and that from sickle cell anemic individuals migrated differently on an electrophoresis plate, illustrating that there was a physical difference in the hemoglobin types and supporting the single gene mutation. Ingram analyzed the different polypeptide chains in hemoglobin molecules using a modified form of Frederick Sanger&#039;s protein analysis. This technique gave a fingerprint of the different hemoglobin types; this showed that the differences between the two types of hemoglobin could be found in one peptide section of eight amino acids. When this section was isolated and analyzed, the only difference was one amino acid (glutamic acid in normal and valine in sickle cell hemoglobin). The difference between these amino acids was one base in the triplet codon. Further analysis showed that amino acid changes in one chain were independent of changes in the other chain, suggesting that the genes determining the alpha and beta chains were located at different loci and show independent assortment. From this, it can be seen that hemoglobin is composed of two independent gene products, each of which is a separate polypeptide. The gene is a section of DNA that determines the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. One gene codes for one polypeptide and several polypeptides may be required for a functional protein or enzyme.</td>

The question asked if two individuals with albinism could have a normal child, also mentioning that albinism is a recessive trait. Well, if it&#039;s recessive, they must be homozygous recessive for the trait to be expressed in each of them, meaning that the child will also be homozygous recessive? Therefore, the child&#039;s enzymes will be non-functional at that point in the metabolic pathway, meaning that he/she will also be albino. However, the quiz (mistakenly?) claims that two recessive albino individuals can have a normal child. I do not understand this at all.</td>

To me, that seems to eliminate the point of the survey if I have to go read the chapter just to complete it when it should be assessing what I learn throughout this course. We also haven&#039;t even remotely touched on any of these topics in discussion which is frustrating to me because the discussion should be improving our understanding of the course material instead of being a different course entirely. So to sum up, the reason I found this topic difficult was the his name is spelled Garrod in the textbook so I had trouble even finding this topic, I couldn&#039;t find the year 1923 mentioned anywhere in chapter 14, and finally Dr. Hughes didn&#039;t teach on this topic so essentially I learned it entirely on my own for the purpose of this survey a week after we have already taken the test on this chapter so essentially for no reason at all. </td>

Normally, I would say I&#039;d review my class notes and reread the text and maybe even group study (all things that have helped me in other difficult classes such as organic chemistry and physics); however, we have already taken the test for this chapter and I was told by Dr. Hughes on Friday, &quot;There is no way to study for my final&quot; so I honestly have no intention of trying to learn anything else about this topic. Please don&#039;t take away credit for my honesty. After all, you told us this survey doesn&#039;t help anybody if we don&#039;t really try so filling this box with a bunch of lies I&#039;m not really going to follow through on won&#039;t help anybody either.  </td>
